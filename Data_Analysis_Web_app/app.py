For those with right ambition it represents an exiting time with opportunities to differentiate and stand out from the crowd. One area that has the opportunity to deliver significant competitive advantage is analytics. At present, automotive companies are capable of collecting and analyzing an enormous amount of raw data. Advancements in data analytics and its fusion with the automotive industry has led to smarter, more connected vehicles, and drastic improvements in sales and marketing. ")
    st.write("IHS Automotive has estimated that an average car produces approximately 30 terabytes of data daily. The onus is then on manufacturers to effectively use the data for competitive advantage. Since so much data is produced, the automotive industry today has turned into a data-driven industry. Thus, automobile manufacturers can use data analytics software to glean new insights into their business and make better decisions, which can then be used to maintain and expand market position and profits.")

    * Designs and Productions:
        * Data science and Data analysis is now being used extensively by manufacturers to improve many aspects of their business processes. For example, once the proper sensors are installed in a vehicle, predictive analytics can easily be used by engineers to view and predict potential issues before they become problems. Therefore, they can advise the customer to go for an early service.
        * With regard to vehicle design, car manufacturing companies are now using data analytic tools to assist the design process by analyzing the performance models to determine the optimal aerodynamics for future models.
    * Sales and Marketing:
        * Another critical use for data analytics in the automotive industry is in personalizing and targeting marketing and sales. Automotive companies understand the value of their customerâ€™s trust and loyalty, and effective usage of data allows an unparalleled customer experience.
        * Predictive analytics is very much in play in the aftermarket services such as maintenance and personalization services, all are being integrated with data analytics in order to provide customers with ever greater levels of service.
        * Additionally, predictive analytics can help the automotive companies to give real-time feedback to the customers, and use it as historical data which then help improve their services in the future.
        
    * Essential Takeaways:
        * We are now living in a time of automotive innovation. From fully electric cars to self-driving vehicles powered by A.I, innovation we could only imagine in the past is becoming part of our daily lives. This has changed our world, and we can thank data analytics for playing a key role in this shift. It has now become critical that all automotive businesses make full use of data analytics to optimise their manufacturing, customer service and other business areas.
        * Thanks to the data-driven age we are living in, data analytics software is now able to help the automotive industry to design and build better cars today, and help make the cars of the future a reality.

        st.write("we can say that indian Market has many varients of cars with different type of body type and different features.The Top 5 companies with more than car variants in India are Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata, and Toyota. Though we can say that most favourable body type in indian market is Hatchbacks and SUV. Most of the cars are having petrol and diesel as their fuel type. Power is an importent feature price increase with the power but mileage decrease whith increasing power.Torque is directly propostional to power hence it is also propostion to price.From the above data we also get to know that cars in Indian market has decent horsepower. Indian market loves car with decent values of power and performence of the engine. Ex-Showroom price is positively correlated to Displacement.Ex-Showroom Price is Positively Correlated to the number of Cylinders. This means, more the number of cylinders, more the ex-showroom price.The more the number of cylinders in a car, the more will be its displacement. Generally speaking, the higher an engineâ€™s displacement the more power it can create.The number of doors is highly negatively correlated with Displacement. That makes sense, right since sports car has less number of doors and its mileage is very less and the power is very high including price. Now lets look into features like new technologies and safety and other features. Indian market is catching up to most of new technology. Most of the cars are having power steering with electric or hydraulic power.Almost all cars have power window. Keyless entry is also present in most of the cars.Indian also prefer audio system and bluetooth in their car Most of the cars have 4-10 number of seats which means Indian buyer loves big cars which makes sense since most favourables cars in indian market are SUV and Hatchbacks. Buyers do like leather as their seat fabric. Most of the cars are automatic and hence tells us that Indian market is moving towards automation. Indain market has also uses advanced feature for brake system, theft proof system , Multifunction Display etc. For aadvanced brake system:-EBA_(Electronic_Brake_Assist),EBD_(Electronic_Brake-force_Distribution) these technologies are present in most of the cars which is also good for safety purpose. But on the same hand It is does not have ESP,EBA which is also new technologies hence we can say Indian market has decsnt or average amount of cars with new technology. For theft system:- most of the cars are having Engine Immobilizer which only activates engine if the correct key is being inserted.We can say that half of the Indian buyers are having family since 40 % of indian buyers are having ISOFIX_(Child-Seat_Mount) feature which is an extra seat attached on the back seat for kids and having Child Safety Locks. In the field of safety most of the cars has decent or average safety since Indian buyers are fond of budget cars and hence most of the cars has 1 air bag and cars with 5 airbags are less in numbers which has high price.")

We can see that all the cars are now seperated with clusters some cars may have same cluster which will help us to make a strategy to counter the compititon as a company. Companies can use cluster analysis to generate good strategy to lead the market.As we took an example of Tata nexon a car model manufactured by Tata one of the leading automobile company. We looked into the cluster it belongs to and analyzed it we saw that most varients are of the car makers in those clusters are Maruti Suzuki , Hyndai, Mahindra. With clustring there are too many variable taken in considration which are hard to be traced by normal methods. The clusters generated by the KMeans model can be used to identify what is the strategic group that form a strong competition to the company products in the market it also show the close clusters to this group which also can be put in considration in some cases.Though as tempting as it's to use clustring to produce strategic groups it worth mentioning that the clustring process itself is a little bit ambigous and features contribution to the clustering process can't be easily explained so the overall interpretability of the model forms a challenge.Clustring may be not determinant but it can be used to augment the management decision by using it side by side with human intuition to come out with the right strategic group.")
